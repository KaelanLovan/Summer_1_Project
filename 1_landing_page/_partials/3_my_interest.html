                  The Hidden Genius Project was made to help black male youth provide for themselves and teaches them neccessary life skills. I joined the Hidden Genius Project so that I could learn how to develop my leadership skills and help my community. I also joined so that I could get a better understanding of coding.

                  The program helps young black men develop leadership and entrepnuership skills while also teaching them how to code and help their communities. All of these are reasons that influenced me to join the program
