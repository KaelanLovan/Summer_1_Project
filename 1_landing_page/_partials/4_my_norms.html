                                There are many things that interests me about The Hidden Genius Project Mission Statement, one of
                                which is,


                                <strong>
                                    <em>
                                        "To transform their lives and communities.""
                                    </em>
                                </strong>

                                I like this part because it shows that we can all help our community in one way or another. 

                                Another point that stands out to me is,


                                <strong>
                                    <em>
                                        "The Hidden Genius Project trains and mentors black male youth in technology creation, entrepreneurship, and leadership skills"

                                    </em>
                                </strong>
                                I also like this part because it is showing that it helps young black men learn skills to bring themselves up.
                                If this doesn't happen we will not be able to help and provide for our communities.
