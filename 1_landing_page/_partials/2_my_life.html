                                I was born in San Jose, California, on April 28th, 2005. I moved to Richmond California in around 2010. I attended St.David's elementry school for multiple years until 7th grade. From 7th to 8th grade I went to Summit K2 middle/highschool. I am currently attending Middle College Highschool and entering my Sophmore year. I live with both my parents and have 2 sisters, one older and one younger than me.

                                From a young age I was taught many lessons by my parents. One of these lessons was to always work my hardest to achieve my goals. This lesson has made me push through times where I wasn't doing good in sports but I would still strive to better myself. Another lesson is that if you want something you have to earn it. Whenever I would want to get something from the store or something else my parents would make me do certain tasks such as extra chores.
